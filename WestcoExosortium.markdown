## Johnathon Anderson, PhD

### University of California, Davis

Dr. Johnathon Anderson directs the Exosome Team at the University of California Davis' Institute for Regenerative Cures. This works involves investigating mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes as potential therapeutics for the treatment of ischemic tissue diseases (ischemic retinopathy, PAD) and acute brain injuries (ischemic stroke, TBI). This approach uses a combination of genetic engineering and high throughput omics strategies, combined with functional in vivo studies.

## James D. Bryers, PhD

### Professor, Department of Bioengineering (University of Washington)

### Adjunct Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering (University of Washington)

The Bryers research group is one of perhaps only two or three engineering-based research groups investigating
the interaction of bacteria, immune cells, and biomedical implant materials. Thier research over the past 20 years has
defined and quantified the biological and physical processes governing (1) the formation and persistence of microbial
biofilms in biotechnological and medical systems, (2) control of macrophage phenotype at biomaterial interfaces, and (3) developed biomaterials that promote infection immunity.  Current research activities are (1) developing anti-biofilm biomaterials, (2) creating biomaterials that promote immunotherapy and enhance vaccine efficiency, and (3) tissue regeneration by exosome engineering.

## Elena Hsieh, MD

### Assistant Professor of Immunology & Microbiology and Pediatrics (Unviersity of Colorado, Denver)

Dr. Elena Hsieh earned her MD degree from University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in 2008.  She completed a residency in pediatrics at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2011, and a fellowship in Allergy and Immunology at Stanford University in 2014.  She continued her research and clinical work at Stanford University as an Instructor for an additional year.  In 2015, Dr. Hsieh joined the faculty at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, jointly affiliated with the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Colorado.  Dr. Hsieh studies immune dysregulation in autoimmunity, primary immunodeficiency, and the overlap between the two.

## Thomas Anchordoquy, PhD

### Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Science (Unviersity of Colorado, Denver)

Dr. Thomas Anchordoquy has been working on lipid-based drug delivery systems for over 30 years, and he finds it interesting that nature has evolved a similar delivery system.  In collaboration with Michael Graner, they have studied the ability of exosomes to deliver drugs in vitro and in vivo.  In addition, they have done extensive proteomic analysis of exosomes harvested under various conditions.  He would be interested in communicating with anyone who is exploiting exosomes or the exosomal pathway for drug delivery.
