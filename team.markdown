## Michael S. Mulligan, MD

### Principal Investigator

#### Professor, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (University of Washington)

#### Director of the Lung Transplant Program

#### Director of Advanced Lung Disease Surgery Program

Dr. Mulligan is a UW professor of cardiothoracic surgery and the director of the Lung Transplant Program and the Advanced Lung Disease Surgery Program. He is clinically busy in lung transplantation and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). He also is the surgeon in the Pacific Northwest who performs pulmonary endarterectomies for chronic pulmonary embolic disease.

In addition, Dr. Mulligan directs the Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery Program. He performs a range of lung cancer resections regularly. He is considered a national expert in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and leads regional and national courses on the subject. He also has considerable experience in the management of esophageal cancer.

He has won local and national teaching awards and runs an NIH-funded laboratory. His areas of scientific investigation include the mechanisms of acute lung injury following lung transplantation. regulation of tolerance in long-term lung graft acceptance, and lung ischemia reperfusion injury.

## Billanna Hwang, MPH

### Research Scientist / Baby PI

Billanna (Billie) is currently a Research Scientist and baby PI under the direction/training of Dr. Michael S. Mulligan. She received her BS in Biology at Seattle University, furthered her studies by obtaining an MPH, and now completing her doctorate. Her research background is in bone marrow and solid organ transplant immunology with focus in tolerance induction/mechanisms, GVHD, and regulatory T cells. Majority of her research history has been at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and she continues to do collaborative research with those investigators. She continues her research using cell immunotherapy in pulmonary diseases and as a platform for tolerance induction in a solid organ transplant setting. Outside of research she continues to play volleyball at the top level in the region and runs a volleyball club/training program.

## Pablo Sanchez, MD

### Acting Assistant Professor

Pablo is a Thoracic Surgeon and an Assistant Professor with the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of Washington.  In November 2009 he was recruited by the University of Maryland Artificial Organ Laboratory to establish an ex vivo lung perfusion laboratory. In August of 2012 his team performed the first lung transplant in the U.S. using EVLP to screen donor lungs that were initially deemed not transplantable due to poor quality. Currently, he is one of three national Principal Investigators for the NOVEL trial. This FDA clinical trial is investigating the safety of EVLP to screen the unused donor pool. He has trained and helped centers in the United States, Europe and Asia to start their EVLP programs.

Pablo recently moved to the University of Washington to expand his work on EVLP. As a member of the Center for Lung Biology, his goal is to continue to investigate the use and clinical translation therapies administered during EVLP to ameliorate the effects of Ischemia Reperfusion Injury while improving lung transplant outcomes.

## Brian Beard, PhD

### Research Consultant

Brian received his B.A. in biology with a minor in chemistry from the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, Colorado, USA and his PhD in biochemistry from Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, USA. After he received his PhD he worked as a clinical research scientist for ten years on genetic therapy of bone marrow transplantation at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, USA. Since 2013 Brian has volunteered with various organizations working on community and global health in Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and Asia.

## Rachel Waworuntu

### Research Scientist

Rachel joined the Mulligan Lab in 2014 and began assisting in hematology counts and ventilation protocols. She originally came from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center learning about hematology in various bone marrow transplants and also worked with the HIV Vaccine Trails unit. Afterwards, she moved to the Center of Lung Biology researching the effects of mechanical ventilation. Rachel continues to help support the Transplantation Biology group at FHCRC. She graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in MCD Biology and is currently studying for her MPH.
