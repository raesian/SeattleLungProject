# Michael S. Mulligan, MD

## Principal Investigator

### Professor, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery

#### Director of the Lung Transplant Program and the Advanced Lung Disease Surgery Program

Dr. Mulligan is a UW professor of cardiothoracic surgery and the director of the Lung Transplant Program and the Advanced Lung Disease Surgery Program. He is clinically busy in lung transplantation and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). He also is the surgeon in the Pacific Northwest who performs pulmonary endarterectomies for chronic pulmonary embolic disease.

In addition, Dr. Mulligan directs the Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery Program. He performs a range of lung cancer resections regularly. He is considered a national expert in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and leads regional and national courses on the subject. He also has considerable experience in the management of esophageal cancer.

He has won local and national teaching awards and runs an NIH-funded laboratory. His areas of scientific investigation include the mechanisms of acute lung injury following lung transplantation. regulation of tolerance in long-term lung graft acceptance, and lung ischemia reperfusion injury.

## Billiana Hwang, MPH

### Research Scientist

Billanna (Billie) is currently a Research Scientist and baby PI under the direction/training of Dr. Michael S. Mulligan. She received her BS in Biology at Seattle University, furthered her studies by obtaining an MPH, and now completing her doctorate. Her research background is in bone marrow and solid organ transplant immunology, with focus in tolerance induction/mechanisms, GVHD, and regulatory T cells. Majority of her research history has been at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and she continues to do collaborative research with those investigators. She continues her research using cell immunotherapy in pulmonary diseases and as a platform for tolerance induction in a solid organ transplant setting. Outside of research she continues to play volleyball at the top level in the region and runs a volleyball club/training program.

## W. Conrad Liles, MD, PhD

### Collaborator

W. Conrad Liles, MD, PhD is currently Professor and Associate Chair of Medicine and holds adjunct appointments in the Departments of Global Health and Pathology. He graduated magna cum laude from Williams College (USA), then entered the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored MD-PhD program (Medical Scientist Training Program) at the University of Washington (USA) and graduated in 1987 with an MD and a PhD in pharmacology. Following residency in Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1987-1990, he returned to the University of Washington where he served as Chief Medical Resident in 1991 and as a Fellow in Infectious Diseases from 1992-1995. In 1996, he was appointed to the faculty at the University of Washington as Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and rose to the rank of Professor of Medicine and Adjunct Professor of Pathology. In March 2006, Dr. Liles moved to the University of Toronto to assume the position of Director of the Division of Infectious Diseases, where he worked to develop translational research programs in sepsis, emerging infectious diseases and infectious diseases of public health importance, including malaria and sepsis. At the University of Toronto, he received the Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) in Inflammation and Infectious Diseases and was a member of the McLaughlin Centre for Molecular Medicine, the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health, and the Toronto General Research Institute. He subsequently served as the Vice Chair of Medicine and Acting Chair of Medicine. In 2012, he returned to the University of Washington as Associate Chair of Medicine. He currently serves as the Interim Director of the Center for Lung Biology (CLB), Co-Director of the Molecular Medicine Training Program, Co-Director of the Molecular Medicine and Mechanisms of Disease (M3D) PhD Graduate Program, and a member of the Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID). As author of more than 200 peer-reviewed manuscripts and 35 book chapters, Dr. Liles maintains an active translational research program as a principal investigator in host defense, infectious diseases, inflammation, innate immunity, sepsis, immunodeficiency disorders, and immunomodulatory therapy.  He received the 2004 Outstanding Investigator Award from the Western Society for Clinical Investigation (WSCI) and has been elected to Fellowship in the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). In 2014, he was elected to the Association of American Physicians (AAP).

## Rachel Waworuntu

### Research Scientist

Rachel joined the Mulligan Lab in 2014 began assisting in hematology counts and ventilation/ischemia protocols. She originally came from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center working with hematology in various bone marrow transplants and also worked with the HIV Vaccine Trails unit. Afterwards, she moved on to the Center of Lung Biology researching the effects of mechanical ventilation. She graduated from the University of Washington and is planning to continue on to graduate studies.
